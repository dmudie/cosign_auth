http://drupal.org/project/cosign

NOTE: this module was derived from the cosign.module. 

Installation instructions
---------------------------
* you must be running your server within a cosign infrastructure.
	More info at: http://www.weblogin.org/
* download the cosign_auth module
* copy the module into your drupal modules directory
* enable the module through the ?q=admin/build/modules page
* configure the module through the ?q=admin/config/system/cosign page
* add the logout block to your page with the ?q=admin/build/block page

The cosign_auth module is not dependent on any other contributed modules, it
does not use the webserver_auth module and does not use or rely on the authmap
table.

If is advisible that the user name used for Drupal UID=1 be a valid cosign
uniqname capable of authenticating with Cosign.  I have used phpmyadmin to
manually change the "name" in the "users" table to such a uniqname.  Of
course, with Drupal 7 you can know assign any user the same capabilities of
UID=1 (or so they claim!).
